Who we hope to find:

PurposeMed is looking for an Intermediate Backend Developer who will help us build our innovative telehealth platform alongside a team of skilled developers.

You'll join our development team, which functions as part of the larger Product/Design/Engineering (PDE) team. This position will be focused on our backend systems and integrating them with our frontend technology. You will be a part of a rapidly growing team of developers, surrounded by great people with expertise across diverse fields such as product management, product design, data science, growth marketing, and more!

Our developers are more than programmers. We hire passionate, curious, and driven problem solvers who are excited to grow and apply their craft to bringing medical access to thousands of Canadians each month.

Though we have an office based in Calgary, this is a remote position that is open to candidates across Canada.

In this role, you'll make an impact by:
• Building our core backend architecture that helps thousands of patients a month while being thoughtful about data structuring and analytics
• Helping to foster a diverse and inclusive, collaborative environment which focuses on delivering high engagement and performance levels
• Collaborating with your colleagues by actively participating in design and architecture discussions
• Implementing analytics and instrumentation into the work that you do so that we can measure its effect on our users
• Writing well-tested code
• Analyzing business requirements and converting them into technical plans
• Giving and receiving feedback from colleagues within the development organization

We need someone who has:
• Capability in Ruby on Rails with 3+ years of professional experience
• A passion for creating usable, elegant, durable software
• A love for collaborating within a fast-moving team but can also be effective working independently when needed
• Reliability, self-motivation, and has strong attention to detail
• A naturally curiosity and comfortability navigating ambiguity
• Effective communication in both written and verbal formats
• Motivation to work in a cross-functional product-focused environment working alongside product managers and product designers

It would also be great if you have:
• Familiarity with, or have a desire to learn, GraphQL, Github Actions, PostgreSQL, and/or Heroku
• An interest in learning to contribute to our frontend technology
• Experience working in an early stage startup

Do you think you could be our next Intermediate Backend Developer? We look forward to seeing your application!

Why you should join us:
• Be part of a team of great people who don't take themselves too seriously. While we're serious about the problems we solve, we believe in having fun along the way.
• Make an impact, every single day. We're providing compassionate, affirming care to many people who have never received care for their condition.
• Receive great benefits from your first day of work. We offer plenty of paid time off, a parental leave top-up program, group benefits, learning stipends and other perks.
• Work flexibly, from anywhere across Canada.* We believe that work should fit around your life. We also have an office in Calgary available for anyone in the area!
• Be confident in bringing your whole self to work. Inclusivity is core to how we take care of our patients, our teammates and ourselves. We create spaces that are safe and affirming.

If you are looking for a place that sparks your creativity, helps others, and will push you to be your best, then you'll love PurposeMed.
• Most of our roles are performed virtually from home (in a distributed team environment) across Canada. Team members who are in "onsite" roles at Affirming Care need to be physically present at our pharmacies.
